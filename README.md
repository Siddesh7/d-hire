# d-Hire - Simply Hiring Process with our 1-stop platform

From scheduling the first call to onboarding call, setup all the calls in a decentralised way with use of ENS names, video rooms by Huddle01, Push Notifications by Push Protocol, Live Streaming (optional) by Livepeer, IPFS for storage.




## Inspiration
Getting the interview calls setup and emailiin the right person was a pain for me personally, so is for all I hope.
## What it does
 d-Hire will help an HR to initially create a jobProcess with a candidate. Then the number of meetings or interviewer can edited by the HR and the interviewer can later setup a call in the same page which also creates a video call room to have the meeting.
No more switching beetween gmail, zoom call, etc.



## Built using decentralised tech
- Easily readable names using ENS - This enables HR, andy user to write an ENS name and it will be resolved for other purposes like sending notifs.
- Huddle01 deRTC adds decentralised video conferencing feature in the app. The interview calls are held in the d-Hire with the help Huddle01 WebSDK.
- Push Protocol is used to promptly send notifications to candidates as well as the interviewer 30 mins before the call begins.
- Livpeer for livestreaming if required.
- IPFS for storing video recording and other files.

## What's next?
- To add more features to make it one stop platform for an HR officer.
